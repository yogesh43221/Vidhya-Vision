## Analytics Vidhya Free Courses Search Tool

## Overview
This project provides a smart search feature for free courses on Analytics Vidhya‚Äôs platform. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using **LangChain**, **FAISS**, and **Streamlit** to create an intuitive, efficient search experience.

The tool is powered by a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework, which combines a retrieval mechanism with generative responses for accurate and contextualized search results.

## Tech Stack
- **LangChain**: For building and managing NLP pipelines.
- **FAISS**: A vector database used to store and search embeddings.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for building the interactive search tool.
- **Python**: For scripting and data processing.
- **NumPy**: For array manipulation, especially embeddings.

## Project Workflow

### Step 1: Data Scraping (Python)
- Scraped free course data from Analytics Vidhya.
- Collected data including course titles, descriptions, ratings, reviews, and other attributes.

### Step 2: Embedding Generation (Python)
- Generated sentence embeddings for each course using an embedding model.
- Saved the embeddings to a `.npy` file for efficient search.

### Step 3: Search Functionality (LangChain & FAISS)
- Built a retrieval mechanism using **FAISS** to index and search course embeddings.
- Integrated with **LangChain** to handle user queries and generate relevant course suggestions based on semantic similarity.

### Step 4: User Interface (Streamlit)
- Developed a simple, interactive Streamlit web app to enable users to search courses.
- Users can enter queries, and the app will return the most relevant courses based on their search.
